First, I started looking at google maps api and example code snippets on how to create simple map with markers, etc. 

Then, I started by checking knockoutjs documentation and finding examples that fit this project.

I found a code example that binds the search box with the list view, using knockoutjs.

After all of the above, I started puttting this pieces together to create the map.

Also, I used foursquare api and jQuery ajax calls to request places around an specific location.
